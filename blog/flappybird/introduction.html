                    In this series of tutorials, you'll learn how to accomplish a variety of things in Ceramic, a 2D media & game engine for Haxe.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now, Haxe is a great language. It can transpile to a variety of languages for cross-platform builds, and it has an insane amount of options when choosing a game engine. It's even been used to make popular games such as Dead Cells, Papers Please, and Northguard! One of the newer avaliable engines is ceramic. Ceramic is a Cross-platform 2D framework written in Haxe that can export natively to desktop (windows, mac, linux), mobile (ios, android), web (js + webgl) and to unity projects. It's extensible, so you can add support for sprites, nape & arcade physics, and more. The engine also has a nice configuring process, and can be configured through a ceramic.yml file and a Project.hx file. You can read more about configuration on the <a href="https://ceramic-engine.com/guides/ceramic-yml-reference/">ceramic website</a>. Because of the ability to compile to unity projects, ceramic projects can also be compiled to any platform that unity supports.

                This game will help you learn a variety of things for ceramic, and how the developing process typically works. These tutorials will help you with learning, in no particular order:

                Let's begin with downloading the ceramic cli tool and creating a project.
                As long as you have haxe and haxelib installed, you can install ceramic by running <code>haxelib install ceramic</code>. Then, run <code>haxelib run ceramic setup</code> to install ceramic on your computer. When on Linux, you may need elevated permissions to install ceramic globally. Now you may run <code>ceramic help</code> to check if the tool is installed. You can see that there a quite a lot of avaliable commands, but only a few will be used in these tutorials. To create a new project, run <code>ceramic init --name flapus-birdus</code>. You will see that a new directory will be created, called "flapus-birdus".
                <hr>
                To run the project, run
                <br>
                <code>
                    cd flapus-birdus
                </code>
                <br>
                <code>
                    ceramic clay run web --setup
                </code>
                <br>
                <br>
                These commands change the cwd to the newly created ceramic project, and then runs it in the web. Electron is enabled by default, so a window will be created with the project. the <code>--setup</code> flag will ensure that the web target is set up correctly before running the project.

                <br>
                And that's it, you have a ceramic project! In the next tutorial, we'll set up the main scene with a background and go over the structure of it, along with how to add assets to the project. You can go over the general structure of a ceramic project in <a href="https://ceramic-engine.com/guides/inside-a-default-project/">this</a> guide on the ceramic engine website.
